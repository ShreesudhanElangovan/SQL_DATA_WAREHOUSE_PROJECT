🗃️ Create Database and Schemas
🎯 Script Purpose

This script creates a new database named sales_performance after checking whether it already exists.
If the database exists, it will be dropped and recreated.

Additionally, the script sets up three schemas within the database:

bronze – Raw/staging layer for ingested data.

silver – Cleaned and transformed data.

gold – Aggregated, analytics-ready data.

⚠️ Warning

Running this script will drop the entire sales_performance database if it already exists.
All data within the database will be permanently deleted.

⚡ Proceed with caution and ensure you have proper backups before running this script.

-- Drop the database if it already exists
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS sales_performance;

-- Create a new database
CREATE DATABASE sales_performance;

-- Use the newly created database
USE sales_performance;

-- Instead of schemas, use schema-like naming conventions
CREATE SCHEMA bronze;
CREATE SCHEMA silver;
CREATE SCHEMA gold;
